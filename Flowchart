I understand that you would like to create a Word document for a flowchart related to CNB application support based on the image you've uploaded. Let me summarize the flowchart, and I will prepare the text accordingly for you to include in a Word document.

### CNB Application Support Flowchart

#### Level 1:
1. **Incident Identification**  
   Initial detection or reporting of an issue within the CNB application.
   
2. **Incident Logging**  
   Recording the details of the incident for tracking and analysis.

3. **Initial Support**  
   First-level support attempts to resolve the issue.
   
   - **Resolved?**  
     - **Yes:** Close the incident.
     - **No:** Proceed to Level 2.

#### Level 2:
1. **Investigate & Remediate**  
   Further investigation and remediation efforts by a more specialized support team.

   - **Resolved?**  
     - **Yes:** Close the incident.
     - **No:** Proceed to Level 3.

#### Level 3:
1. **Investigate & Remediate**  
   Continuation of remediation actions for unresolved issues.

   - **Continue:** If the problem remains unresolved, further remediation efforts will continue.

Would you like me to prepare this flowchart in a visual format (like a Word file or an image) or would you prefer to adjust the text flowchart into the document yourself? Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
