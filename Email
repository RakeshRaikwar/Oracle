Subject: Availability for Evening Shift and Knowledge Transfer

Hi Balaji,

As discussed over chat, I will not be able to log in during the evening today due to Ekadashi Pooja at my home. I will, however, be available throughout my morning shift.

Since there is an overlap between the morning and evening shifts, I can use that time to explain the application to a team member in the evening shift. They can then present the application to the rest of the team, which would help enhance the teamâ€™s knowledge as I am currently on my notice period.

Please let me know if this approach works.

Thanks and regards,
shweta singh
